35,Tara Thomas,Twisted End is the third of three prequel novellas that are opening up Tara Thomas’ new romantic suspense Sons of Broad series. The three novellas definitely need to be read in order together as they are all one continuing story line.In the first novella readers were introduced to detective Janie Roberts who had been working undercover as a bartender while working a case searching for a killer. Janie had met the handsome and charming Brent Taylor and became involved with him even though he may have been a suspect in the case.After starting the relationship with Brent Janie had been fired from her job with the police force but then found herself the target of the serial killer. As the relationship grew between the pair so did the danger with the killer.Twisted End is the perfect title for this third installment of the novella set. The danger had been ramped up as the story continue along with the steamy love story. The story was finally finished for Janie and Brent although the author did leave an opening for the full length novels coming soon to the series. When finished overall the novellas made a great introduction to the series to lead readers to Darkest Night which will change the main couple.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.wordpress....,Romance,"      Twisted End
