92,Sharon Lee,"Life. Luck. Love. Lowport. Life, so the wags tell us, is what happens while we're making other plans. Luck. . .or, as some have it, chance. . .Luck is what makes Life interesting; introducing spicy bits of chaos – good, bad, and neutral. Without Luck, there is no savor – no adventure – in Life. Love. Ah, Love. The yeast of Life, Love expands our horizons, deepens our understanding, and opens our eyes. Love makes us daring. And Lowport? Lowport tries and tests Life, and Luck. And, most especially, Love. So here is small tale of Lives in progress, plans made and altered – and altered again. A tale of bread, and Luck, and Love . . . . . . and Lowport. We start with two people – a baker, Don Eyr; Serana, a captain of the Watch. Two people who have not much in common, until Luck brings them together, and they see each other. What, you say? There are no adventures here? Are you certain? Remember that Luck is involved.
