59,Grace Ellis,"Trigger warnings for the use of slurs - against a fictional race, however - dysphoria and mild violence.If I have said it once, I have said it a thousand times before but I simply adore pastel fantasy worlds. You know the ones that have witches drinking their potions from Starbucks thermos and vampires that cannot take selfies? The AUs that blend modern technology with traditional mythology. You can imagine how excited I was to get my hands on Moonstruck the moment I learned it existed. Lesbian werewolves in a pastel uf coffee shop AU? It was a dream come true! From the very first page, I fell in love with this world and its characters. I quite enjoyed the blossoming relationship between Julie and Selena. It was wholesome and sweet, while still managing to capture the awkwardness and anxiety of developing a crush on someone. Julie’s relationship with Chet, her best friend, was also super sweet. They supported each other through some really difficult times and all the bad puns made my heart burst. Cass was probably my favourite character out of the whole series, though. I cannot wait to see more of her in the next volume!The storytelling and worldbuilding, however, were far from perfect. Some panels were downright confusing. Chapters four and five were a little haphazard and I really hope that the next volume will feel more cohesive and fluid. Elements of the world need more fleshing out in the upcoming issues. I am still unsure how humans fit into this world, and the werewolf discrimination was never really explained. It has so much potential. I just hope that Ellis and Beagle are able to tap into it more in the sequel. The scope of the diversity really made a difference. Attention to detail for small things, - like having wheelchair accessible seats for sirens in the background of the theatre scenes - was wonderful. I also loved that identity and labels were briefly discussed. While it was mainly due to Chet’s situation - tw: body dysphoria - there was an interesting moment between Julie and Selena that I wish had been expanded on.Overall? This was a sweet graphic novel with a lot of potential and amazing artwork. I loved the world and the characters. The world needs a little more detail and the plot needs to be streamlined a little better but damn, its potential has me excited.Rep: Julie (MC) is a plus-sized Latinx lesbian; her love interest (Selena) is a plus-sized black lesbian; Chet uses they/them pronouns and is possibly Latinx (?); multiple other queer, POC and disabled SCs.

Reading this as part of Myths and Magic: An Epic Fantasy and Speculative Fiction Boxed Set
Bec McMaster has been one of my favorite urban fantasy authors ever since I started reading her London Steampunk series back in 2014 -- and it was for my personal challenge too! I found her heroines to be superbly awesome, and her heroes to die for. I've pretty much enjoyed any stories that she released.
Burn Bright
 is definitely another winner for me. I was a bit weary at first because this was a young adult fantasy with blurb (from the box-set) that seemed to allude that this involved a love triangle -- a trope that I totally dislike. But I kept going because I trusted that McMaster would still satisfy me.Well, this did NOT involve a love triangle of any kind. I loved the myth of the universe -- the Darkness being trapped in the forest with five guardians -- was interesting. I also loved how McMaster took a different route for her werewolves/wolvren beings, making them more like selkies (they could change into a wolf form when they slipped inside their wolf skin). And of course Neva was awesome. And Casimir made me swoon.For sure, when this is released individually next month, I'll click that ""Buy Now with 1-Click"" button as fast as I can!",Fantasy,      Burn Bright

But children, ah, children. Children follow the foxes, and open the wardrobes, and peek beneath the bridge. Children climb the walls and fall down the wells and run the razor’s edge of possibility until sometimes, just sometimes, the possible surrenders and shows them the way to go home.
It's not often I give books in a series three five stars in a row, but these stories just speak to an inner part of me - the curious, feminist adventurer who longed for nothing more than to follow Lucy through that wardrobe into Narnia, or Harry through the barrier leading to Platform 9 3/4. This universe is brimming with the timeless magic of fairy tales, and it seems I just can't get enough.If you enjoyed the first two books - Every Heart a Doorway and Down Among the Sticks and Bones - I see no reason not to like this. McGuire is back with a new story, featuring some familiar faces and some newbies too. This latest adventure in the portal world sees the characters heading into the land of Confection (Candy Land, in other words), a place described in almost sickening sweetness, from its Strawberry Sea to spun sugar ropes. Given that this is only a novella, I won't give away too much about the story. I will say, though, that it is compelling, made ever more so by the gorgeous writing. And more than this, the diverse cast of characters come bounding off the pages. McGuire writes teens with diverse skin colours, ethnicities, sexualities, gender identities and disabilities. In this book, she also focuses on issues of weight and its accompanying anxiety, through Cora, who has always felt pressure from others to diet and assumptions that her size is due to lack of restraint or laziness.
Growing up fat had meant an endless succession of diets suggested by “helpful” relatives, and even more “helpful” suggestions from her classmates, ones that suggested starvation or learning to vomit on command.
Lots of authors are trying to break into the feminist fairy tale trend these days, but so far I don't think any of them have been as successful as McGuire.
