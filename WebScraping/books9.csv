I even found out the Pittsburgh Post Gazette newspaper used to be called the Pittsburgh Gazette when it first started out. It's so fascinating the historical facts you can find out with some research and I appreciate the author doing just this.This book held my attention firmly gripped and it won't be soon forgotten.I enjoyed this book immensely and look forward to her next book.I received a review copy from the author and was not required to write a positive review.",Historical,      A Refuge Assured
